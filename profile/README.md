## Join Us

Every member of the Foundry is a Hedera expert. We have been working together since 2018 to build a strong foundation for ourselves and future generations of Hedera builders and visionaries. All builders in the Hedera ecosystem are welcome.

* **Building ecosystem tooling**. Creating and maintaining a comprehensive set of libraries, tools, documentation, and SDKs enhances the accessibility and usability of open source projects.
* **Establishing technical standards**. Through contributing to technology standards, we influence the direction and evolution of the technology itself, resulting in community-driven innovation.
* **Promoting knowledge sharing**. Open and effective communication channels foster a culture of learning and mentorship, allowing anyone to gain insights from experienced contributors.
